# stock-price-brownian-process
This repository explores using Brownian motion to predict stock prices, leveraging the stochastic process' properties to develop accurate forecasting models.

This project takes live stock data of netflix for prediction from yahoo finance.Change the link of data to predict for other companies in the model.py

The key objectives of this repository are:

	->Investigating the suitability of Brownian motion for modeling stock price dynamics
	->Developing and implementing Brownian motion-based algorithms for stock price prediction
	->Evaluating the performance of these algorithms and comparing them to other forecasting techniques
	->Providing a framework for researchers and practitioners to experiment with Brownian motion in stock price prediction
The repository includes the following components:

	->Brownian motion simulation tools:
 				Code for generating Brownian motion processes and calibrating model parameters based on historical stock data
	->Stock price prediction models:
 				Implementation of Brownian motion-based forecasting algorithms, along with evaluation metrics and comparison to alternative methods
	->Data collection and preprocessing utilities: 
 				Scripts for gathering and cleaning stock market data for use in the prediction models
	->Visualization and analysis tools:
 				Interactive dashboards and plots for exploring stock price trends and model performance
